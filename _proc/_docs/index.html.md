$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to BuildingBlocks
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

## Testing Matrix-Vector Dot Product

### Initialize a Matrix and a Vector

```python
a = [[1, 2], [2, 4]]
b = [1, 2]

::: {#cell-10 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
assert matrix_dot_vector([[1, 2], [2, 4]], [1, 2]) == [5, 10], "Test case Passed"

assert matrix_dot_vector([[1, 2], [2, 4]], [1, 2]) == [5, 11], "Test case Failed"
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}
```
