<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The inverse of a matrix \( A \) is another matrix, often denoted \( A^{-1} \), such that:

$$
AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I
$$

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. For a 2Ã—2 matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}
$$

The inverse is given by:

$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}
$$

provided that the determinant \( \det(A) = ad - bc \) is non-zero.

If \( \det(A) = 0 \), the matrix does not have an inverse.

### Importance

Calculating the inverse of a matrix is essential in various applications, such as solving systems of linear equations, where the inverse is used to find solutions efficiently.
